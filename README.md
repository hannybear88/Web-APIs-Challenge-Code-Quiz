# Web-APIs-Challenge-Code-Quiz
Homework Challenge #4




## Project Description
Building a professional portolio was our second homework challenge by using both HTML and CSS. I was motivated to create my own professional portfolio so that when I build one that I use then I will have a better idea on how to build one and how I'd like for it to look. My live page can be seen in the <a href="#Table of Contents">Table of Contents</a> section. It helped me imporve both on my HTML and CSS skills. This assignment also helped us build so that it is user friendly for all devices, mobile and tablets. This was a challenging assignment, yet also fun. It was challenging to use flex-box which will also be very useful in the future.
